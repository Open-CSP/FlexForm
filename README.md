FlexForm is an enhanced HTML5 rendering engine.

It renders HTML5 form elements and allows to edit or create a page or multiple pages with one form.

This version 1 is a complete rewrite and stripped down version from the previous FlexForm.

Compared to the previous version File upload and E-mail are not supported and will be added in a later version.
Rendering of a form has been rewritten to support themes.

Documentation will be added soon.

## Installation

Grab in instance from https://github.com/WikibaseSolutions/FlexForm. Create a "FlexForm" folder in your Wiki extensions
folder and extract the files there.

## Setup

You can tweak FlexForm to an extent in your Localsettings.php

```php
$wgFlexFormConfig['secure']                                 = true; //( default is true ). Will render form that make no sense when inspected in the browser
$wgFlexFormConfig['sec_key']                                = ""; // A salt key for encryption. Used together with "secure" option. Must be set when using multiple instances of a wiki
$wgFlexFormConfig['auto_save_interval']                     = 30000; // defaults to 3 minutes.
$wgFlexFormConfig['auto_save_after_change']                 = 3000; // defaults to 3 seconds after last change
$wgFlexFormConfig['FlexFormDefaultTheme']                   = "Plain"; // Currently the only form
$wgFlexFormConfig['rc_site_key']                            = ""; // reCaptcha site key
$wgFlexFormConfig['rc_secret_key']                          = ""; // reCaptcha secret key
$wgFlexFormConfig['file_temp_path']                         = ""; // When using image upload conversion, we need a place to temporarily store images.
$wgFlexFormConfig['can_create_user']                        = false; // If FlexForm is allowed to create new users
$wgFlexFormConfig['filter_input_tags']                      = false; // Defaults to false. Will filter all parser arguments to plain text, except value parameters. Will also disallow onClick and onFocus parameter. This feature will most likely be removed in future updates.
$wgFlexFormConfig['CreateAndEditForms']['allowedGroups']    = ["sysop","moderator"]; // Defaults to sysop. Only a user in the allowedGroups is able to edit pages with a FlexForm in the source.
$wgFlexFormConfig['CreateAndEditForms']['hideEdit']         = true; // Defaults to true. If a user is not in the allowedGroups then hide edit and editsource menu items for any page containing a FlexForm form.
$wgFlexFormConfig['auto_save_btn_on']                       = "Autosave On";
$wgFlexFormConfig['auto_save_btn_off']                      = "Autosave Off";
$wgFlexFormConfig['use_smtp']                               = false; // when sending email, should we use separate smtp ?
$wgFlexFormConfig['smtp_host']                              = "";
$wgFlexFormConfig['smtp_authentication']                    = true;
$wgFlexFormConfig['smtp_username']                          = "";
$wgFlexFormConfig['smtp_password']                          = "";
$wgFlexFormConfig['smtp_secure']                            = "TLS";
$wgFlexFormConfig['smtp_port']                              = 587;
```

Finally add the following line at the end of your LocalSettings.php to enable the extension :

```php
wfLoadExtension( 'FlexForm' );
```

FlexForm has a notification system build in. This is used to show possible errors or success / custom messages.

To enable this.. add to your header page :

```html

<_form showmessages/>
```
